paths.py
--------
Single source of truth for every filesystem location in the project.

--- WHY THIS EXISTS ----------------------------------------------------------
Paths written relative to the current working directory -- "./data/cache.gpkg"
and the like -- resolve only when the terminal happens to be sitting in the
project root. Invoked from one directory up, from an IDE with a different
working directory, or from a scheduled task, Python looks for those files
somewhere they do not exist.

That failure is worse than a crash, because a missing cache file is
indistinguishable from "no cache yet". Rather than erroring, the pipeline would
quietly start a 45-minute rebuild.

PROJECT_ROOT is therefore derived from THIS FILE's own location on disk, which
is fixed relative to the rest of the repository regardless of where it is
cloned to or invoked from. The working directory stops mattering entirely.
