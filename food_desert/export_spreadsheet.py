    Plain-language caveats for one row:

    * the nearest shop's location was inferred from ISTAT's register rather
      than mapped, so the distance is to the centre of the settlement it was
      placed in;
    * for a comune's main town, the specialist food shops ISTAT registers in
      the comune -- a bakery or a butcher is not a grocery, so the town stays
      in the results, but a reader should know it is not without food shops.
      Only main towns get this: the register gives no locations, and a
      comune's specialists are most likely in its main town, not a village.
